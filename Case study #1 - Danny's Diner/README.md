# CASE STUDY #1 - DANNY'S DINER
## General information
**Case study source:** [Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)

**Dataset:** [Here](https://github.com/bokw/8_week_SQL_challenge/blob/main/Case%20study%20%231%20-%20Danny's%20Diner/CS1_data.sql) you can find script with dataset and table creation process using SQLite.

**Problem:** Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Questions and Solutions
### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```SQL
SELECT
	sales.customer_id
	,SUM(menu.price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM CS1_sales sales
LEFT JOIN CS1_menu menu
ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id 
GROUP BY
	sales.customer_id;
```
#### Output
|customer_id|total_amount_spent|
|-----------|------------------|
|A          |                76|

			  WHEN sales.order_date > DATE(members.join_date, '+6 days') AND menu.product_name <> 'sushi' THEN menu.price * 1 * 10
		END)  AS bonus_points
FROM CS1_sales sales
INNER JOIN CS1_members members
ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id 
AND members.join_date <= sales.order_date 
LEFT JOIN CS1_menu menu
