FROM CS1_sales sales
LEFT JOIN CS1_menu menu
ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id 
GROUP BY
	sales.customer_id;
```
#### Output
|customer_id|total_amount_spent|
|-----------|------------------|
|A          |                76|

	,COUNT(DISTINCT sales.order_date) AS visit_count
FROM CS1_sales sales
GROUP BY

```
#### Output
|customer_id|visit_count|
|-----------|-----------|
